        Kanaka Durga Temple: A place where you will find yourself

    </string>

    <string name="kanaka_durga_temple_description">

        Kanaka Durga Temple is a famous hindu Temple of Goddess Durga located in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. The temple is located on the
        Indrakeeladri hill, on the banks of Krishna River. Kaalika puraana, Durgaa sapthashati and other vedic literature have mentioned about Goddess
        Kanaka Durga on the Indrakeelaadri and have described the deity as Swayambhu, (self-manifested) in Triteeya kalpa.\n\n

        According to a legend, the now verdant Vijayawada was once a rocky region strewn with hills that obstructed the flow of River Krishna.
        The land was thus rendered unfit for habitation or cultivation. Invocation to Lord Shiva for His intervention directed the hills to make
        way for the river. And the river started flowing unimpeded with all its might, through the tunnels or "Bejjam" bored into the hills by
        Lord Shiva. That is how the place got its name Bezawada. One of the many mythologies associated with this place is that Arjuna prayed to
        Lord Shiva on top of Indrakeela hill to win His blessings and the city derived its name "Vijayawada" after this victory. Another popular
        legend is about the triumph of goddess Kanakadurga over the demon King Mahishasura. It is said that the growing menace of demons became
        unbearable for the natives. Sage Indrakila practiced severe penance, and when the goddess appeared the sage pleaded Her to reside on his
        head and keep vigil on the wicked demons. As per his wishes of killing the demons, Goddess Durga made Indrakila Her permanent abode. Later,
        She also slayed the demon king Mahishasura freeing the people of Vijayawada from evil. At the Kanakadurga temple, the enchanting 4-foot-high
        (1.2 m) icon of the deity is bedecked in glittering ornaments and bright flowers. Her icon here depicts Her eight-armed form -each holding
        a powerful weapon- in a standing posture over the demon Mahishashura and piercing him with Her trident. The goddess is the epitome of beauty.
        Adjacent to the Kanakadurga temple is the shrine of Malleswara Swamy on the Indrakeeladri. By ascending the steps on the hill, one comes
        across little images of different deities, prominent among them are Kanaka Durga, Malleswara and Krishna(River).\n\n

        Kanaka Durga Temple is synonymous with Vijayawada. It is mentioned in the sacred texts.This is the place where Arjuna obtained the
        Pasupatha astra after his great penance for Lord Shiva. The temple was constructed for Goddess Durga by Arjuna. It is connected by steps
        and a ghats road. The temple occupies an important place in the scriptures as several of the Siva-leelas and Shakti-mahimas were enacted
        on or around it, making the region a place of unequaled spiritual significance and attracting pilgrims since times immemorial.It is mentioned
        in the Vedas that the deity in the Kanakadurga temple is regarded as \'Swayambhu\' or self-manifested, hence considered very powerful.
        Inscriptions of different dynasties are found in the temple.

        Prakasam Barrage: A bridge that connects two districts

    </string>


    <string name="prakasam_barrage_description">

        The structure of the Prakasam Barrage stretches 1223.5 m across the Krishna River connecting Krishna and Guntur districts. The barrage serves also as a road bridge and
        spans over a lake. The three canals associated with the barrage run through the city of Vijayawada, crossing it and giving it a Venetian appearance.\n\n

        The idea of constructing a dam across the river Krishna dates back to 1798. It began in the hands of captain Buckle and was revised in 1839 and 1841 by Captain Best and
        Captain Lake.After the endorsement of Major Cotton, the board of Directors of the East India Company approved it on 5 January 1850. The dam was started in 1852 and completed
        in 1855. It cost Rs 1.75 crore in those days and seems to have paid the then government a return of 18%. It used to irrigate 7 lakh acres.[2] Later, the State Government
        constructed a bridge that was named after Tanguturi Prakasam, the first Chief Minister of Andhra (a state formed in 1953, which later became Andhra Pradesh in 1956 after the
        merger of Telugu speaking districts of former Hyderabad State). Completed in 1957, it helps to irrigate over 1.2 million acres of land. This barrage also supplies water to
        Buckingham canal which was initially constructed as an inland navigation canal but was later used as an irrigation water supply canal. One of the first major irrigation
        projects of South India, the Prakasam Barrage in Vijayawada was completely successful in its mission.\n\n

        Andhra Pradesh largely owes its rich agriculture to the Prakasam dam as the project facilitated the irrigation of large tracts of farmland. The dam provides views of the
        lake.It has become a tourist attraction of Vijayawada. The barrage has 76 pillars in total; 70 pillars belong to Guntur district and 6 belong to Krishna district.
